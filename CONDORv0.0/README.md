# CONDOR
Code for characterising individual anomalous diffusion trajectories (CONDOR). The code was developed in response of the AnDi Challenge for the inference of the anomalous diffusion exponent and for the prediction of the diffusion model in single trajectories. Currently, a new user friendly version is being developed and will be released soon.
